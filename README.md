This is created as an example for ["Sub directory" pages not working](https://github.com/digitalocean/sample-nextjs/issues/2).

The valid routes are `/one`, `/two`, and `/nested/three`.

The generated static files will be `one/index.html`, `two/index.html`, and `nested/three/index.html` and therefore will be accessible without the `.html` extension in the URL.
